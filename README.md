# Project Description



We set out to make a Rummy-O game that is easy and fun for users to play. We achieved our goal by delivering a platform that is simple, yet effective.

When users enter our website, they have the choice to either login (if they are already a user) or sign-up (if they are new to the site). If they are a new user, they will be directed to a new page that will ask them for a username, email, password and other account information. Once they have created an account, they will log in. Now that the user is on the home page, they will have the option to start a new game. User clicks “New Game” and will be brought to a game match. Once there are 2-4 players in the match, the game with start and users will be playing against each. Finally, when the game finishes the program will calculate/declare the winner and send the players back to their individual home page.

We created our website using HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and MySQL. Using these languages in tandem with each other allows use to provide our users with a program that is stylish and with great functionality.
